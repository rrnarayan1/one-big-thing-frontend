# Welcome to One Big Thing!

What is this? This is a project by Rohan Narayan to pull data about the "One Big Thing" (OBT) from each NBA game. This analysis is done by simply taking the z-score of all of the statistics available in the box score. The mean and standard deviation are taken from the team's average stats over the seasonâ€“therefore, the "One Big Thing" is trying to find a statistic that "stood out" for the team in the win.

The backend logic for OBT is available here: https://github.com/rrnarayan1/one-big-thing-backend

I've attached screenshots of the website below for the public to get a sense of what this will look like.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Screenshots

#### Game Scores Page: 
Each stat for each game is assigned a score, which is the z-score of that stat for this team for that current season. It gives a sense of "how unusual" that number is for that team.

#### Team Season Log: 
Each game for that team is visible, as is the "one big thing" for that game. This is calculated by taking the stat with the highest z-score.

#### Team Season Summary: 
Currently, this modal only shows the statistic that was most often the OBT in wins, and the stat that was most often the OBT in losses, along with a histogram of those stats in games won and lost.
