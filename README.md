# Welcome to One Big Thing!

What is this? This is a project by Rohan Narayan to pull data about the "One Big Thing" (OBT) from each NBA game. This analysis is done by simply taking the z-score of all of the statistics available in the box score. The mean and standard deviation are taken from the team's average stats over the season–therefore, the "One Big Thing" is trying to find a statistic that "stood out" for the team in the win.

The backend logic for OBT is available here: https://github.com/rrnarayan1/one-big-thing-backend

I've attached screenshots of the website below for the public to get a sense of what this will look like.
